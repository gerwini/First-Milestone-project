# Legends of Runeterra Randomizer

## Click on the images to enlarge them!

## Nav bar
At the randomizer nav button you can randomize your very own that that you can play with! at the different nav-items with **regions** (demacia, freljord, ionia, noxus, PandZ, shadow isles) you can take a look
at the different **champions**(iconic units that all bring a different win-condition for your play), **followers**(units that can help achieve a win con or get control of the game) and **spells**(cards that have effects either helping you or messing with the opponent)!
In the footer you can take a look at the site of "Legends of Runeterra" and the most recent Patch notes (which has updates regarding to the game).

## The game
Legends of Runeterra is a card game which uses characters and the lore of the world of "runterra" which is used in the video game called "League of Legends". Its a 1v1 game where you use cards to try and bring
the opponents Nexus (the players base which starts with a health of 20) health to 0. To do this you can use all kinds of different cards from different regions, mana costs, effects etc. The only limit is your imagination
of finding cards that work well together and try to achieve the same thing. In the info tab is a short breakdown of a "follower" card.

## Who is it made for
This site is made for people that enjoy playing Legends of Runeterra but are not sure as to what kind of deck they want to play. Take a look at all the different options then select what
regions and what playstle you would like to play and its randomize time!!

## What does it do
* The randomizer option will let you randomize your deck.
* The different pages is the navigation will show you the different regions to take a look at what they contain.
* In the footer you can find links to the site and the most recent patch notes.

## What will I do
When I learn more about javascript and other programs ill make it so that the site will actually randomize and allow you to get a random set of cards to play with!

I plan to add the total costs and rarity of the cards needed so that you can see if you can afford them or not.
Besides the randomizer option that will be added at a later date the site works well and has been tested in different screen sizes to make sure it looks good in all of them!

## What have I used
* The images used are taken from " https://rankedboost.com/legends-of-runeterra/ " 
* the code for a dropdown menu is from " https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/dropdowns/ "
* The modals I got from: " https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/modal/ "
* and the script written for those I got from someone else since I have yet to learn javascript.

## tested and bugs
* I have tested my site multiple times to try and make sure it works as intended and kept changing my code and css until it did, and this is the final result!
* One time my gitpod started crashing by creating infinite files of the First Milestone Project which took me a while to figure it out but I succeeded in doing so.

## Devlopment/deployment
I added the testing and bugs to my README, removed some comments used to test my site and made my css file a little more clear.
